I'm a third year postgraduate researcher in the Institute of Geophysics and Tectonics, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds. My research focuses on the use of InSAR to constrain patterns of deformation throughout Iran, both to understand the large-scale tectonics and the local seismic hazard. My first paper focuses on constraining the interseismic slip rate and locking depth of the Main Recent Fault, a 800 km long strike-slip fault in the Zagros mountains. We have produced the first InSAR-derived slip rate for the fault, and the first geodetically-determined estimate of the locking depth, which is key to assesments of the seismic potential of this major fault.

I am an active member of COMET (https://comet.nerc.ac.uk/), a UK-wide research group, along with the Tectonics and Geodesy groups within the School of Earth and Environment. Before Leeds, I completed an undergraduate degree and a Masters degree at Durham University, the latter exploring multi-objective optimisation for the automated designing of low-cost GNSS networks.

Outside of work I'm normally reading, gaming, or trying to break a gravel bike.
